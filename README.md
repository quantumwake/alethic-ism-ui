# Alethic Instruction-Based State Machine Studio UI (ISM)
Alethic ISM Studio is the web-based workbench for building, visualizing and running instruction-based state-machine workflows in real time. It connects to the core ISM components so you can design programmable pipelines and execute them interactively. Learn more on the Alethic ISM homepage.

Instructions can invoke code, query data, direct large language models, or perform structured transformations. Each node applies an instruction to an input state via a processor, producing a new, versioned, immutable output state. Together, these nodes form computable workflows that are fully executable, traceable and reproducible.

The system is experimental and is under active development as part of Bioethics with AI research supported by the University of Oxford and the National University of Singapore, with previous research support from Princeton University.
